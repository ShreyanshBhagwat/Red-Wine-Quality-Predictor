Project Description:
This project aims to predict the quality of red wine using machine learning classification techniques based on its physicochemical properties. The dataset contains various chemical attributes such as alcohol content, acidity, pH, sulphates, residual sugar, and density, along with a quality score assigned by wine experts.
The project starts with data exploration and preprocessing, including checking for missing values, understanding feature distributions, and analyzing correlations between chemical properties and wine quality. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to identify key factors influencing wine quality, with alcohol content and sulphates showing strong relationships with higher quality ratings.
The wine quality scores were then transformed into categorical labels (such as good quality and bad quality) to frame the problem as a classification task. Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing approach for quality prediction.
Model performance was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The final model successfully learned patterns from the chemical composition of wine to predict its quality with reliable accuracy.
This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in the food and beverage industry, enabling producers to maintain quality standards, optimize production processes, and make data-driven decisions.
